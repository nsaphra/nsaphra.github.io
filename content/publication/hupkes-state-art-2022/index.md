abstract: "The ability to generalise well is one of the primary desiderata of natural\
  \ language processing (NLP). Yet, what `good generalisation' entails and how it\
  \ should be evaluated is not well understood, nor are there any common standards\
  \ to evaluate it. In this paper, we aim to lay the ground-work to improve both of\
  \ these issues. We present a taxonomy for characterising and understanding generalisation\
  \ research in NLP, we use that taxonomy to present a comprehensive map of published\
  \ generalisation studies, and we make recommendations for which areas might deserve\
  \ attention in the future. Our taxonomy is based on an extensive literature review\
  \ of generalisation research, and contains five axes along which studies can differ:\
  \ their main motivation, the type of generalisation they aim to solve, the type\
  \ of data shift they consider, the source by which this data shift is obtained,\
  \ and the locus of the shift within the modelling pipeline. We use our taxonomy\
  \ to classify over 400 previous papers that test generalisation, for a total of\
  \ more than 600 individual experiments. Considering the results of this review,\
  \ we present an in-depth analysis of the current state of generalisation research\
  \ in NLP, and make recommendations for the future. Along with this paper, we release\
  \ a webpage where the results of our review can be dynamically explored, and which\
  \ we intend to up-date as new NLP generalisation studies are published. With this\
  \ work, we aim to make steps towards making state-of-the-art generalisation testing\
  \ the new status quo in NLP."
