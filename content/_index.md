        My core research is centered on a single agenda: to completely and comprehensively understand the training of language models. This objective combines linguistics, optimization, training dynamics, science of deep learning, interpretability,  and behavioral analysis. I have extended recently towards using similar approaches to study scientific discovery models, enhancing broader scientific understanding.

        My current publication list is available on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TPhVfX8AAAAJ&hl=en).
